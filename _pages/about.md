I graduated from `Santa Clara University` in June 2023. Having spent most of my life in Taiwan, I am now based in the San Francisco Bay Area. New ideas and impactful pursuits energize me each day. In particular, I am driven by the potential of technology to transform lives and redefine our world.

I am currently seeking full-time or internship opportunities in software engineering. Interested in all kinds of spaces in `software engineering`. What matters to me is building practical tools to address real problems. My passion for engineering and innovation isn't just a profession, but a lifelong pursuit. I'm not just ready to learn, but eager to dive in, make tangible contributions, and bring about meaningful change.

Beyond software engineering, I'm interested in the ethical impact of technology on society. I often think about how tech should fit into our personal lives and the wider community. I'm influenced by thinkers like Tristan Harris and am keen to explore these intersections further.
